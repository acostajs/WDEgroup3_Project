# Proof of Concept: Staff Scheduling & Performance Tracking

## Overview
This project explores automating staff scheduling and performance tracking for Pozole restaurant. The goal is to optimize scheduling, reduce labor costs, and improve efficiency using automated scheduling and real-time performance monitoring.

## Problem Statement
Manual scheduling leads to inefficiencies, such as overstaffing during slow periods and understaffing during peak hours. Additionally, there is no clear system to track employee performance, making it difficult to reward high performers or address inefficiencies.

## Key Features
- **Automated Scheduling** – Assigns shifts based on predicted customer demand.
- **Performance Tracking** – Monitors employee efficiency, mistake rates, and attendance.
- **Real-Time Insights** – Generates reports on labor costs and staff productivity.
- **Payroll & Attendance Integration** – Ensures accurate tracking of hours worked.
- **Shift Notifications** – Notifies employees of updated schedules.

## Technology Stack
### Option 1:
- **Front-end:** Vanilla TypeScript + HTML/CSS or Vue.js
- **Back-end:** Node.js with Express (TypeScript)
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (free tier) or MySQL (AWS free tier)
- **Hosting:** Render (back-end), Vercel/Netlify (front-end)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth/Auth0 (optional, free tier)

### Option 2:
- **Front-end:** React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Back-end:** Python with Django
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (free tier on Supabase)
- **Hosting:** Railway (back-end), Cloudflare Pages (front-end)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (free tier)

## Work Plan
1. **Define Requirements:** Identify the essential features for scheduling and performance tracking.
2. **Choose Technology Stack:** Decide which of the free full-stack options best suits the project.
3. **Set Up Development Environment:** Configure hosting, database, and authentication services.
4. **Develop Scheduling System:** Build an interface for assigning shifts and storing schedules.
5. **Implement Performance Tracking:** Create dashboards to monitor employee efficiency and attendance.
6. **Integrate Payroll & Notifications:** Ensure accurate labor cost tracking and automate shift updates.
7. **Test & Optimize:** Run tests with sample data, fix issues, and refine the system based on feedback.
8. **Deploy & Gather Feedback:** Release the prototype, collect insights from managers and employees, and make improvements.

## Testing & Evaluation
Success will be measured by:
- Accuracy of automated scheduling.
- Reduction in last-minute shift changes.
- Improved labor cost management.
- Feedback from managers and employees.

This system aims to automate scheduling and improve efficiency, ensuring that the right employees work at the right times while optimizing labor costs.
